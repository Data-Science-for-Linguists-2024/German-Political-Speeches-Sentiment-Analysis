# Riley's Project Idea
## German Political Speeches Sentiment Analysis

#### Brief Summary
I would use the corpus to analyze the patterns of topics in the speeches based on different demographic information.
 
#### Data 
I found a corpus of German Political speeches from 1984 to 2017. The data is in xml files that have the data separated by speech. The corpus has the data for the name of the speaker, political title of the speaker, the place, date, a brief speech summary, the link to where the speech was found, and the speech itself. There are 6,685 speeches from 71 speakers.

Here is the link to the download page: https://zenodo.org/records/3611246 

### Analysis
I want to do some sentiment analysis based on speaker, political party of the speaker, and other demographic information. I would also want to look diachronically and see if there are linguistic trends over time. I think the analysis will become more clear as I take a better look at the corpus and other possible data sources. 

### Presentation 
I don't really have anything of note yet.
