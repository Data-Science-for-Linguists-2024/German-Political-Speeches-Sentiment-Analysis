# Final Report
By Riley Hesbacher

## Introduction
I looked at sentiment scores across political parties in Germany. Sentiment is a view or attitude towards something, and this can be measured in speech using sentiment scores that indicate how positive or negative a word or phrase might be. This can show underlying opinions toward a subject or demonstrate change in opinions over time. I wanted to see how this could apply to political speech that is often more curated. 

## Background
I wanted to use sentiment analysis to look at the possible differences in sentiment across German political parties. I was also interested in finding any patterns of how the sentiment scores of these parties might change over time.
