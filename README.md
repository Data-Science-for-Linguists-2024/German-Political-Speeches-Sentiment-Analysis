# German Political Speeches Sentiment Analysis
#### Riley Hesbacher's term project

In this project, I will use the corpus of German political speeches to analyze sentiment towards different topics. I would compare the sentiment based on different demographic criteria, including political party affiliation, and I would compare sentiment diachronically.
