#### Project Description
In this project, I use the corpus of German political speeches to analyze sentiment between different parties. I compare the sentiment based on different parties and compare how the sentiment of individual parties changed over time and how those changes could align with current events of the time.

#### Corpus of German Political Speeches
Adrien Barbaresi. A corpus of German political speeches from the 21st century. 11th Language
Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC 2018), May 2018, Miyazaki, Japan. pp.792-797. ffhal01798703f

This corpus consists of 6,685 speeches by 71 speakers, spanning a time from 1984 to 2017 and amounting to about 13 million words. These speeches come from speakers who are a part of the German government. The speeches are split into which office the speaker was from: the chancellery, the presidency, the Bundestag or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The corpus includes the speech, the speaker, the date and the location where the speech was made.
